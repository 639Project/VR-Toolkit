## Optical Character Recognition:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) extracts text from images. This technique divides an image into various subsections of a matrix, and then checks if each subsection of the matrix is empty or not. Based on whether it is empty or not, it extracts characters. 

- Implementing OCR using the `tesseract` library in python.
